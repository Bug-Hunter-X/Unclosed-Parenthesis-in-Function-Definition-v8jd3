This repository contains a demonstration of a common Python error: unclosed parentheses in function definitions. The `bug.py` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.py` provides the corrected version. The error occurs when parentheses are not properly closed in a function definition, causing a `SyntaxError`.  The solution involves simply ensuring that all parentheses are correctly closed.
